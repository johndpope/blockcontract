# Block Contract

This is a hackathon project for "The Building Blocks Hackathon at Consensus 2019" (https://consensus2019-blockchain.devpost.com).

Block contract is to build decentralized contract that people can sign, view and trust. To protect the privacy, the content of the contract will *NOT* be hosted in the blockchain, *only the hash* of the content is store in the chain.

We use [ArcBlock's Forge React Stater](#about-forge-react-starter) to build this application and let it handle the basic logic like DID login, so that we can focus on building the core logic.

## High level design

The prototype of the flow of the app looks like this:

![prototype](docs/prototype.jpg)

## Contract Templates

[Accord Project](https://www.accordproject.org) is a great open source tool to generate legal contracts.  The ultimate goal is integrate this project with Accord [Legal Contract Template Studio](https://studio.accordproject.org).

## Blockchain

We will use ArcBlock's ForgeFrame to build a custom blockchain for this project's demo.  The block explorer lives here: [Block Contract Block Explorer](https://contract.abtnetwork.io/dashboard)

It's possible to use other blockchains, such as Ethereum, Bitcoin to record the contract through Open Chain Access Protocol (OCAP), but it will be limited in features.

## DB schema for contract

For contract created by the user, we store it as the following schema in mongo:

```javascript
const ContractSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  // the did is calculated by sha3(concat(content, hash, signatures list without each sig))
  _id: { type: String, required: true, trim: true },
  requester: {type: String, required: true, trim: true},
  synopsis: { type: String, required: true, trim: true },
  content: { type: Buffer, required: true },
  hash: { type: String, required: true },
  signatures: [{
    name: { type: String, required: true, trim: true },
    email: { type: String, required: true, trim: true },
    signedAt: { type: Date },
    signature: { type: Buffer }
  }],
  finished: { type: Boolean, default: false},
  address: { type: String, default: '' },
  createdAt: { type: Date },
  updatedAt: { type: Date },
});
```

## Asset Schema for CreateAssetTx protocol

Once a doc is finished signing, we will send a CreateAssetTx to Forge, with its data like this:

```proto
message Signature {
  string name = 1;
  string email = 2;
  string signer = 3;
  google.protobuf.Timestamp signed_at = 4;
  bytes signature = 5;
}
message Contract {
  // did of the contract that stored in the Block Contract app
  string did = 1;
  // hash of the original contract to be signed
  string hash = 2;
  // collected signature list
  repeated Signature signatures = 3;
}
```

## Run this project from Repo

### Install latest nodejs and mongodb

```bash
brew upgrade node
brew install mongodb
brew services start mongodb
```

### Install latest forge-cli and init forge

```bash
npm install -g @arcblock/forge-cli
forge init
forge join https://contract.abtnetwork.io/api
forge start
forge web start
```

### Start the Block Contract app

```bash
cd block-contract
make dep
```

Before running the app, you need to put a `.env` file into your repo:

```bash
cat > .env
MONGO_URI="mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/block-contract"
COOKIE_SECRET="0x6721a1883a8a9c08ea431a6528faf4c1a220194e8a3c0bed6159fd9737b4b7db"
CHAIN_ID="contract-2019-05-12"
CHAIN_HOST="https://contract.abtnetwork.io/api"
APP_NAME="Block Contract"
APP_PORT="3030"
APP_SK="0x93d1b3a3a75fd5d0a989bf91958442e15896e0c1cfa6a0d542a47861fdc8559e6721a1883a8a9c08ea431a6528faf4c1a220194e8a3c0bed6159fd9737b4b7db"
APP_ID="zNKgNRoV2s12JBsEB9dCc6RiqGYt5JHKRxqv"
EMAIL_USER="<your gmail address>"
EMAIL_PASS="<your gmail password>"
BASE_URL="http://<your-private-ip>:3030"
```

Note that you need to put your gmail user/pass and tune the BASE_URL here.

Make sure that you have your cellphone installed [ABT Wallet](https://abtwallet.io/en/) and it is under the same WIFI as your laptop running the app. Then:

```bash
make run
```

## Screen Shots

Pages are being added so screen shots will be gradually available:

### Scan QR code to login (provided by Forge React Starter kit)

![login 1](docs/login1.jpg)

After you scanned the QR code with ABT wallet:

![login 2](docs/login2.jpg)

Then you are redirect to profile page. User can see the existing contracts:

![List contracts](docs/list_contracts.jpg)

You may want to create a new contract:

![Create contract](docs/create_contract.jpg)

And all the signers will go emails like this:

![Email content](docs/email.jpg)

Below is created by forge-react-starter. Leave it just for your information.

## About Forge React Starter

This project is generated by ArcBlock's Forge React Starter:

> Brings tons of thousands react libraries/components to dApps that run on [forge](https://www.arcblock.io/en/forge-sdk) powered blockchain.

![](./docs/starter-home.png)

A starter project that integrates [forge](https://docs.arcblock.io/forge/latest/) [javascript sdk](https://docs.arcblock.io/forge/latest/sdk/javascript.html) with mainstream javascript application batteries:

- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) the framework for view layer
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) for crafting pages and SSR
- [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/) for resuable react components
- [Express.js](http://expressjs.com/) as custom web server that can serve custom api
- [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) as database ORM layer

Forge SDK libraries included in the starter project:

- [@arcblock/graphql-client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@arcblock/graphql-client) as communication layer between application and forge powered blockchain
- [@arcblock/did-auth](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@arcblock/did-auth) help application do jwt based auth with ABT wallet
- [@arcblock/did-auth-storage-mongo](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@arcblock/did-auth-storage-mongo) storage engines that powers the magic behind ABT Wallet qrcode scanning
- [@arcblock/react-forge](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@arcblock/react-forge) react components that can implements basic UI elements to connect your application with ABT Wallet, such as avatar and auth dialog

Other javascript project goodies:

- `eslint`: for consistent coding style
- `prettier`: for consistent code formatting
- `husky`: and `lint-staged` for prepush and precommit hooks
- `nodemon`: for auto restart server on node.js code change
- `next.js`: supports hot reload on client code change
- `dotenv`: to load configurations from `.env` files
